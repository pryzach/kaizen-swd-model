  <!-- Preface
  ================================================== -->
  <div class="bs-docs-section">
    <div class="page-header">
      <h1 id="preface">Preface</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="">
I was born in world where equality and stability was claimed as main purpose, that goal attracted millions of people under it's red banners.
It is not the idea that fails people - but it's implementation, which resulted in inefficiency, corruption and huge waste. 
I believe that equality and stability can be achieved along with constant improvement, incorporation of innovation, while constantly performing waste removal.
	</p>
	<p>
Enterprises are like small countries and while trying to treat everybody equally, provide stability and measure their own success they, sometimes, fall prey to the same issues: 
they might miss on opportunity to use diversity, promote talent, encapsulate pride in workmanship and during attempts to measure own success - 
sometimes start introducing waste to the system in form of unneeded bureaucracy and extensive reporting.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>
This model is published as Work In Progress. I am strong believer that communities are stronger than any individual and, in current era - when
we all are "connected", some great solutions can be created together.
		</strong>
	</p>
	
	<h3 id="preface-evolution">Building rather than rebuilding</h3>
	<p class="">
Every great idea was already told before and it's a slim chance that in our 60 years of adult life we would be able to say something different than billions before us... and they had couple thousand of years to do that.
<p>
<p>
Due to size and effort invested in current systems - I believe that recreating might be a wasted effort, and instead we need to focus on what was done good and build on top of it.
The only way to do it - is to improve our cooperation, promote talent and single direction/vision, improve pride in workmanship and remove waste.

	<blockquote class="alert-info">
		<p>Model consists of cycles</p>
		<small>Provides control over development, adaptability to requirements change and visibility of result</small>
	</blockquote>
	
	<blockquote class="alert-info">
		<p>Cycle consists of 4 phases</p>
		<small>Phases provides separation of responsibilities and process under control</small>
	</blockquote>
	
	<blockquote class="alert-info">
		<p>During 3rd phase - new cycle is started (so-called sub-cycle)</p>
		<small>The goal is to provide supply for the next cycle (while current cycle is "constructed")</small>
	</blockquote>
	
	<blockquote  class="alert-info">
		<p>Length of cycle cannot be less than 2 weeks</p>
		<small>Very short cycles won't give enough time to perform all activities efficiently</small>
		<small>For support tasks – 2 week cycle is allowed, but amount of checkpoints should be decreased to 1-2</small>
		<small><strong><a href="kaizen-lite.html">Kaizen Lite</a></strong> model is introduced to meet requirements of support tasks</small>
	</blockquote>
	
	<blockquote class="alert-info">
		<p>It is recommended that length of cycle won't be longer than 2 month</p>
		<small>Long cycles would eliminate visibility and might slide into endless development</small>
	</blockquote>
	
	<blockquote class="alert-info">
		<p>Every cycle is both functionality and time boxed</p>
		<small>Functionality is important as it delivers value to the customer</small>
		<small>Time is important as it influences deadline and budget of the product</small>
	</blockquote>
	
	<blockquote class="alert-info">
		<p>PM/TL set direction (manage), BA/Tech Lead provide vision (requirements/architecture) and SME/Team provide construction</p>
		<small>It is important to select best people for the task. This approach allows using best talent and experience for the task and, therefore, decreases possible waste</small>
	</blockquote>
	
	<blockquote class="alert-info">
		<p>Direction, vision and construction is done in "pairs"</p>
		<small>Project manager and Team Leader (together) provide direction</small>
		<small>Business Analyst and Technical Leader (together) provide vision</small>
		<small>SME's and Team (together) provide construction</small>
	</blockquote>
	
	<blockquote class="alert-info">
		<p>Working in pair promotes peer review and cooperation</p>
		<small>Cooperation of roles (work in pairs) is crucial part of the model/project as it improves cooperation between business and IT, allows peer review and ensures that needs/constraints of business/technology are taken into account</small>

		<p>Milestones are defined by Business Analyst and Technical Lead</p>
		<small>BA delivers business requirements and technical lead compiles technical requirements</small>

	</blockquote>
	
	<blockquote class="alert-info">
		<p>Recommended maximum duration of milestone is 1 week</p>
		<small>Long milestones are hard to design, harder to modify (after requirements change) and are prone to be left uncompleted due to time constraints.</small>
	</blockquote>
	
	<blockquote class="alert-info">
		<p>Change in requirements, during development phase, results in its move to the next cycle</p>
		<small>Such change require additional requirements clarification and re-evaluation of technical solution/design</small>
	</blockquote>
	
	<blockquote class="alert-info">
		<p>Showcase/presentation should be performed after milestone delivery</p>
		<small>Presentation improves visibility for business and confirms that it is implemented according to expectations</small>
	</blockquote>
	
	<blockquote class="alert-info">
		<p>Functionality first, optimization - after</p>
		<small>Milestone should deliver functionality (value for the customer), optimization should be performed after the delivery (during last phase of the cycle)</small>

	<h3 id="waste-checkpoints">Checkpoints</h3>
	
	<br/>
	
	<p class="">Checkpoints are meant to help you evaluate current situation and update risks, issues and debt log.</p>
	
	<p class="">Debt log owners (<strong>Direction</strong> pair) should participate in every checkpoint. Meeting should have predefined duration. By default every phase is ended by a checkpoint:</p>
	
	<div class="col-md-12"><p>
			<strong>Requirements (egg):</strong>
	</p></div>
	<div class="col-md-11 col-md-offset-1">
			<p>Recommended duration is 1h. Pair BA+Tech Lead (with PM+TL) analyse progress so far and discuss/update risks, issues and debt log.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="col-md-12"><p>
			<strong>Planning (pupa):</strong>
	</p></div>
	<div class="col-md-11 col-md-offset-1">
			<p>Recommended duration is 2h. PM+TL with BA+Tech Lead analyse progress so far and discuss/update risks, issues and debt log.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="col-md-12"><p>
			<strong>Construction (metamorphosis):</strong>
	</p></div>
	<div class="col-md-11 col-md-offset-1">
			<p>Recommended duration is 2h. Team+SME's with PM+TL reflect upon progress so far and discuss/update risks, issues and debt log.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="col-md-12"><p>
			<strong>Delivery (birth):</strong>
	</p></div>
	<div class="col-md-11 col-md-offset-1">
			<p>Recommended duration is 4-8h. Everybody reflects upon progress so far and discusses/updates risks, issues and debt log. Next step - would be final vote of debt value (details in logs section). Afterwards - all logs should be analysed and recycle plan should be compiled. It is important to look at dynamics in all logs (between phases) and trace risks which became issues; issues which left unattended and generated debt; and debt which was valued as low but turned out to be very high.</p>
	</div>
	
	<p>In case when cycle length is set to 2 weeks - it is recommended to at least keep last checkpoint and decrease it's duration.</p>
	<p>Every additional checkpoint can be set depending on project needs.</p>

  </div>
  
  <!-- Logs
  ================================================== -->
  <div class="bs-docs-section">
    <div class="page-header">
      <h1 id="logs">Logs</h1>
    </div>
	
	<p class="">Usually every log is available for everyone, but update is performed by log owners; by their own volition or by request from other member. 
	That brings benefits as owner might ask additional questions, provide addition opinion/view and would be aware of all items in the log. 
	Consequently this would allow for everybody to have single contact point regarding items in the logs.</p>
	
	<p>
	Even though every log have it's owner – <strong>Direction</strong> pair could frequently review them and discuss it with owners.
	</p>

	<p>
	If it wasn't done during phases - it is advisable to update logs during every checkpoint, which means, by default, that they should be updated at least 4 times per cycle.
	</p>
	
	<h3 id="logs-milestones">Milestones log</h3>
	<div class="col-md-11 col-md-offset-1">
			<p>Milestones log owner is <strong>Vision</strong> pair. Amount of milestone details is defined on per project basis: 
			for short cycles and cases where developers have good understanding of business and technical requirements – amount of details can be kept to minimum, 
			but as amount of milestones and/or size of time rises – it is very important to provide sufficient amount of details (might need consultation with a Team). 
			It is better to overdo rather than provide too little information.</p>
	</div>
	
	<h3 id="logs-risks">Risks log</h3>
	<div class="col-md-11 col-md-offset-1">
			<p>Risks log owner is <strong>Vision</strong> and <strong>Direction</strong> pairs. 
			Risks log can be filled according to any preferred Project Management standard template.</p>
	</div>
	
	<h3 id="logs-issues">Issues log</h3>
	<div class="col-md-11 col-md-offset-1">
			<p>Issues log owner is <strong>Construction</strong> pair with possible support from <strong>Direction</strong> pair. 
			Issues log is filled according to any preferred Project Management standard template.</p>
	</div>
	
	<h3 id="logs-debt">Debt log</h3>
	<div class="col-md-11 col-md-offset-1">
			<p>Debt log owner is <strong>Direction</strong> pair. Every debt log should keep description of the debt (enough to identify it to outside party) with 3 values:
			perceived debt value (provided by requester), perceived debt value (provided by <strong>Direction</strong> pair) and final value - actual debt value - would be defined and entered
			during last checkpoint.	During said checkpoint meeting – every item in debt log is voted (by everyone) and actual debt value is entered. 
			By doing so - we could visualize the difference between perceived debt (during development) and actual debt of the project which, in turn, would allow us to identify "icebergs" and "overblown" debt and compile Recycle plan accordingly.</p>
	</div>
	
	<h3 id="logs-recycle">Recycle plan</h3>
	<div class="col-md-11 col-md-offset-1">
			<p>Recycle plan owner is <strong>Direction</strong> pair. 
			It is the one of the most important part of delivery (birth) phase and it is strongly advisable to include everyone in discussion and brainstorming sessions. 
			Risks and issues logs (from all checkpoints) are analysed, as it is important to understand which risks turned into issues and, consequently, which issues created debt. 
			After debt log goes through voting and perceived debt was compared (by everyone) with actual debt - improvement plan is compiled.
			Debt log serves as main source of information and ordering for recycle plan.</p>

  <div class="bs-docs-section">

	<p>It is very important to visualize your current process to see work done and make adjustment when needed.
	By visualizing you will be able to see process more clearly, you will be able to visualize impact of issues on your project and track waste more effectively.</p>
	<p>There are a lot of online tools out there, which would allow you to visualize your work flow and it is highly recommended that you select one (which suits you best).</p>
	
	<h3 id="visualize-kanban">Kanban method</h3>
	<p>As you've seen by now - this model inherits features from few existing methodologies / processes / models one of which is Lean process;
	Kaizen model is highly focused on waste tracking and removal, which is one of the priorities of Lean process as well. 
	Kanban method works well with Lean and, by inheritance, works great with this model as they share the same goal.</p>
	
	<p>It is very advisable to use Kanban method and Kanban board with this model, as it would help focus on topics that are outside of scope of this document and significantly improve organization / visibility which, as a result, would substantially improve efficiency of process as a whole.</p>

	<p class="text-center"><strong>Instead of Ending</strong></p>
	<p>The same as every mechanism consists of same mechanical parts – every methodology have a lot in common. This comes from the fact that they all are trying to solve the same problem while selecting different approaches.</p>
	<p>In the world where we don't want have one company to produce everything (monopoly), we want to wear different clothes, drive different cars, have different houses... and just to stay unique – I don't believe that there is something that would fit every purpose. Don't expect this model to work for every company, on every level and for every project - always select what fits best.</p>
	<p>This model was meant to bring departments closer, remove waste and improve processes but please don't consider it (or any other model) as solution for problems within the company. Driver which crashed Volkswagen will definitely crash Ferrari as well, and will do it much more faster. Please prepare proper foundation before making any major changes in the processes.</p>
	<p><br/></p>
	<p>Even if you won't agree with model in general, I really hope you will be able to take something from it to improve processes / cooperation / commitment in your company.</p>
